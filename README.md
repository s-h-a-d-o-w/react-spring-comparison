Compares animating transition on mounting and unmounting between 
`react-spring` and `react-transition-group`.

I'm not sure why `react-spring` has gotten so popular considering this 
basic flaw. If someone can see flaw in my implementation that causes this,
please submit a PR (or feel free to send me an email).
